	* This is adding Elliot's GNU-ify patch.
	* Today also got a new CD image for 9 that does the ksdevice=eth0
    magic.
    * Implemented "owner" key
    * changed % handling so that the %blah --options is included in the ks.
    This makes %pre, %post, etc useful when you want to run..say...python
    * The Reinstall Workstation boot option used the URL of the server
    that was build in such a way that everytime that was used it add an ./
    to the URL.  I believe I've fixed that with building the URL in ks.py
    a little more sanely.
    * You can use the "use" key multiple times now and it even works.

	* Argh I hate the changelogs.  I'm going to through in the change
    log here from index.html.  Hopefully this version will be more 
    detailed.

    * Glaring bugs in the check.py script are fixed.
    * The docs for the 'use' keyword have been cleared up a bit. Need to be
    carefull about current directories and paths.
    * Implemented including scripts in the config files after a '%post' key.
    See the examples.
    * Completely changed how mouse configuration is done. This now works with
    all types of mice that the Red Hat Kickstart stuff knows of. See the
    docs.
    * Added support for the 8.0 RK. The version string is "8.0".
    * 02/14/03 - Moved the Debug Tool to a WRAP'd directory that's served from
    secure.linux.ncsu.edu to protect the information while you are debuging.
    * 02/14/03 - We do not send a default kickstart anymore if there is no
    config file. You must have a config file.
    * 02/14/03 - Moved to permanent location in AFS.
    * 04/14/03 - Added support for the NCSU Realm Kit for Red Hat Linux 9 AKA
    Shreak. The version string is "9".
    * 04/24/03 - Added RK 9 boot CD.
    * 05/08/03 - Added "enable safepartition" key and changed the default size
    of /var/cache to 512MB, /var to 390 and /boot to 75. I've also added a
    new option to the src key and changed the default to that option of
    "http" which installs from install.linux.ncsu.edu.
    * 06/05/03 - Added "enable keepmbr" which doesn't overwrite the MBR with
    the bootloader. The bootloader is placed in the boot partition (/boot).
