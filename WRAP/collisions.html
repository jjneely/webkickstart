<h1>Checking for multiple configs with the same name</h1>

<p>This tool is provided so that you can see if anyone else has created
a config file for your computer. We search for files in a top down fasion. 
So if someone else has a directory before yours in the search path and creates
a config file for one of your machines, or purhaps someone forgot to remove the
config for a host name that you are now using. There config would get returned.
This could cause all sorts of security problems, because they would now
have root access to your machine.</p>
