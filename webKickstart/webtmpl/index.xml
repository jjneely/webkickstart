<h2>Config File Debugging Or Kickstart Preview</h2>

<p>To debug your config file for a host enter the IP or FQDN of the host
in the box below.  This will show you the kickstart that will be sent
to that host when it is Web-Kickstarted.  If there is an error a
hopefully helpful message will appear.</p>

<form action="debugtool" method="post">
<p>IP or host name: <input type="text" name="host"/>
<input type="submit"/></p>
</form>

<h2>Collision Detection</h2>

<p>What happens when there are two or more config files for the same
host?  Well, its not good.  Enter in the the IP or FQDN of a host name
to this tool and it will report config file collisions.</p>

<form action="collision" method="post">
<p>IP or host name: <input type="text" name="host"/>
<input type="submit"/></p>
</form>

<h2>Old Config Files</h2>

<p>To help folks be able to clean out old config files this tool will list
all the config files for hosts that no longer resolve in DNS.  Click the 
submit button.</p>
