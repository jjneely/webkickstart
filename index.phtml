<h1>Jump Start for the Linux Realm Kit</h1>

<p>Red Hat Linux uses an automated install system known as Kickstart.
Very basically, this is a detailed text file that the Red Hat Linux
installer can retrieve and use to install the machine rather than
asking the a human many questions.  One of the most powerful methods
of delivering a kickstart file to the installer is by HTTP which
allows complex scripting to generate the proper kickstart file.  This
is what we are doing here.</p>

<p>The Solaris Kit on campus uses the Solaris equivalent known as Jump
Start which has a few key advantages.  First, its well known and
understood around campus, it uses include files much more easily that
kickstart can, and most common configurations can be done in four or
five lines rather than hundreds.  Hence, this system was developed to
take a config file in the form of a Solaris Jump Start, convert it to
a Red Hat Kickstart, and HTTP it directly to the requesting client for
installation.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>This system is designed to generate a <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.3-Manual/custom-guide/ch-kickstart2.html">Red
Hat Linux Kickstart</a> to install the <a
href="http://www.linux.ncsu.edu/realmkit">NCSU Realm Kit for Red Hat
Linux</a>.  A config file can be used to customize the kickstart that
is delivered.  There are two ways to produce a config file.  A normal
kickstart file can be used or a Jump Start style config file can also
be used.  The files must be named the same as the target computers
hostname.  Files must be placed under the following directory:</p>
 
<tt>/afs/bp/system/config/linux-kickstart/configs</tt>.

<p><b>Note:</b> Using a jump start config file to install the NCSU Realm 
Kit for Red hat Linux has two requirements.  First, the machine must be 
configured to use DHCP.  Secondly, its IP address received from DHCP must 
resolve to a domain name.</p>

<h3>Disk Image</h3>
<p>Here's a disk image that is set up to automatically do a
kickstart install from web-kickstart.linux.ncsu.edu.  (This was done
by modifying the syslinux.cfg file on the floppy.</p>

<h3>Recent Changes</h3>

<p>The following are some recent changes to the system there were made
after I released it to public testing.  These changes are also
documented in the <a href="docs/keywords.txt">keywords.txt</a> file or
their relivant place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Glaring bugs in the check.py script are fixed.</li>
<li>The docs for the 'use' keyword have been cleared up a bit.  Need
to be carefull about current directories and paths.</li>
<li>Implemented including scripts in the config files after a '%post'
key.  See the examples above.</li>
<li>Completely changed how mouse configuration is done.  This now
works with all types of mice that the Red Hat Kickstart stuff knows
of.  See the docs.</li>
<li>Added support for the 8.0 RK.  The version string is "8.0".</li>
<li>02/14/03 - 
Moved the Debug Tool to a WRAP'd directory that's served from 
secure.linux.ncsu.edu to protect the information while you are debuging.</li>
<li>02/14/03 - 
We do not send a default kickstart anymore if there is no config
file.  You must have a config file.</li>
<li>02/14/03 - 
Moved to permanent location in AFS.</li>
<li>04/14/03 - 
Added support for the NCSU Realm Kit for Red Hat Linux 9 AKA Shreak.  The
version string is "9".</li>
<li>04/24/03 -
Added RK 9 boot CD.</li>
<li>05/08/03 -
Added "enable safepartition" key and changed the default size of /var/cache
to 512MB, /var to 390 and /boot to 75.  I've also added a new option to the src key and changed the
default to that option of "http" which installs from install.linux.ncsu.edu.</li>
<li>06/05/03 -
Added "enable keepmbr" which doesn't overwrite the MBR with the bootloader.
The bootloader is placed in the boot partition (/boot).</li>
<li>06/20/03 -
Implemented "owner" key.  Fixed % handling so that anything after a line
beginning with "%" is included, including that % line.  This makes adding
%post, %pre, etc a bit more useful as you can pass options to them.  Fixed 
case where the use keyword is used more than once.  Fixed the growing URL problem when the Reinstall Workstation boot option is used.</li>
<li>08/26/03 -
RAID and LVM support for versions 9 and higher.  The part, raid, volgroup,
and logvol keys are all used just as you would use them in a Red Hat
Kickstart.  An example provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Debuging Tool</h2>
<p>
For security reasons the debuging tool has been moved to a WRAP protected
directory.  Please email <a href="mailto:linux@help.ncsu.edu">
linux@help.ncsu.edu</a> if you are not on the access list and think you
should be.  Otherwise, 
<a href="https://secure.linux.ncsu.edu/web-kickstart/WRAP/index.html">
start debuging</a>.
