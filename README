Introduction
------------

Your IT team has thousands of workstations and servers to maintain just
like every other enterprise class organization or educational institution.
Hundreds of these machines run Red Hat Linux or a custom distribution
based on Red Hat Linux or Fedora Core.  Clearly you need an automated
solution to install these linux machines and configure them properly for
your environment.

With Red Hat Linux or Fedora Core this is where Kickstart comes into
play.  You simply have a custom boot disk that grabs the kickstart file
off a server and automates the complete install or just with the ks
boot option.  However, your kickstarts are mostly the same except for 
small bits, like a printer, and there's not an overly good way to have 
server based kickstart that can include other kickstarts.  Also, other 
folks in your IT team(s) may not know how a kickstart works enough to 
create them.  Kickstarts are long and tedious.

Here is where Web-Kickstart comes in.  Web-Kickstart reads small
config files from a central location, such as your distributed file
system or a server.  These files follow in a similar style to
<key> [value ...].  With two to four lines you can have a highly
customized and configure linux install.  Config files can include
other files, and you can even attach multiple %post's and %pre's.
Web-Kickstart takes this config file, loads it into a Python class
that you can customize, dynamically generates a complete kickstart,
and sends it to the installing client via HTTP.  For example, I can
install a Realm Linux 9 machine (which is a customized version of
Red Hat Linux 9 used at NC State University) with something this
simple:

   version 9
   printer cox359a@print-server.ncsu.edu
   enable adminusers jjneely

This specifies the version to install which is the only required line,
specifies the proper default printer, and adds a user to the administrative
users for the machine.  The rest of the install is controlled by the
defaults in the class.  

Included is a class and documentation for installing stock Red Hat Linux
or Fedora Core.  I also include the working classes that we use at NC
State University to install Realm Linux as an example for how you can
customize the software.  Classes for install rPath Linux are also
included but not tested by myself.

Feedback and patches welcome!


Installing
----------

Installing the software is pretty easy.  There are a couple of things
that are still specific to the setup at NCSU that we are working out
so we can have a more generally useful project.  Accepting patches.

You will need an Apache server with mod_python setup and running on 
a machine that has read access to your distributed file system or
where ever you want to keep your config files.  I'd recommend a 
virtual host dedicated to this service.

    http://web-kickstart.linux.ncsu.edu

All the files in this tarball go into the top level directory that is 
served out on the virtual domain.  You want to be able to do a

    http://web-kickstart.linux.ncsu.edu/ks.py


The directory that contains your configuration files can be anywhere on
your system.  However, Apache must be able to read them.

Lastly, make sure that the Apache overrides are set properly to let 
mod_python code run.  With this version you will also want to edit the
web pages so that they have the extension html instead of phtml which
is for a templating engine called Pharser we use at NCSU.


Configuring
-----------

The next part of the install is setting up the config file called
solaris2ks.conf.  There is an example included that is fairly well
documented.  Start from there.  This is where you map the version keys,
like '9' in the above example, to a class and supply some base URLs.
Also, the path to where you store the configuration files must be
included here.

At this point you should have a semi-working system.  Make a few config
files and start testing and customizing.
