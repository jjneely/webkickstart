This is version 0.2.0 of solaris2ks. It should handle most of the
common NCSU Realm Kit kickstart configuration for 7.3, 8.0, and 9.

Very basically, this pile of python needs mod_python and apache and
takes Solaris Jump Start like config files and serves out Red Hat
Kickstarts.

For real information see the docs/ directory and the index.html file.
