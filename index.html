<h1>Jump Start for the Linux Realm Kit</h1>

<p>Red Hat Linux uses an automated install system known as Kickstart.
Very basically, this is a detailed text file that the Red Hat Linux
installer can retreive and use to install the machine rather than
asking the a human many questions.  One of the most powerfull methods
of delivering a kickstart file to the installer is by HTTP which
allows complex scripting to generate the proper kickstart file.  This
is what we are doing here.</p>

<p>The Solaris Kit on campus uses the Solaris equivalent known as Jump
Start which has a few key advantages.  First, its well known and
understood around campus, it uses include files much more easily that
kickstart can, and most common configurations can be done in four or
five lines rather than hundreds.  Hence, this system was developed to
take a config file in the form of a Solaris Jump Start, convert it to
a Red Hat Kickstart, and HTTP it directly to the requesting client for
instalation.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>This system is desinged to generate a <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.3-Manual/custom-guide/ch-kickstart2.html">Red
Hat Linux Kickstart</a> to install the <a
href="http://www.linux.ncsu.edu/realmkit">NCSU Realm Kit for Red Hat
Linux</a>.  A config file can be used to customize the kickstart that
is delivered.  There are two ways to produce a config file.  A normal
kickstart file can be used or a Jump Start style config file can also
be used.  The files must be named the same as the target computers
hostname.  Files must be placed under the following directory:</p>
 
<tt>/ncsu/jjneely/web-kickstart/configs</tt>.

<h2>Debuging Tool</h2>
<form action="ks.py" method="post">
<p>
This tool is provided so that you can test the system and see the
kickstart that it will send a specific machine.  It should be very
useful for tracking down configuration error and bugs in the system.
Enter the DNS host name or the IP address of a machine below to see
the Red Hat Linux Kickstart that would be generated for it.</p>
