Schema Notes
============

This is a file for notes and the definition of the MySQL schema
that solaris2ks expects to find to log data into.  I don't actually
use all the fields here but yeah...  Ideally, a third-part could
make a complementary MySQL table or, perferably, recode the
security module to interact with the DB/schema of your choice.

CREATE TABLE realmlinux (
    hostname    VARCHAR(255),
    installdate DATETIME,
    recvdkey    TINYINT,
    publickey   TEXT,
    lastcheck   DATETIME,
    dept        VARCHAR(32),
    version     VARCHAR(32)
);
