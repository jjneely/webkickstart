This file contains all the key words that can be within a config file
and is used to generate a kickstart.  The file takes commands
delimited by newlines of the type

    <key> [option1] [option2] [option3] [...]

where the 'enable' key is a special case of the above.  Any key, and
its options/arguments, that is not known is ignored by the sys.  For
example, if you use the 'mac' keyword and specify the machines mac
address this key will be silently ignored.  (Having the MAC address
does not give this system any advantages.)  Options may also be
contained within double or single quotes so that an option may contain
spaces.  Also, have comments that begin with a '#' are supported.
