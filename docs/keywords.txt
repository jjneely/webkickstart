keywords.txt

This file contains all the key words that can be within a config file
and is used to generate a kickstart.  The file takes commands
delimited by newlines of the type

    <key> [option1] [option2] [option3] [...]

where the 'enable' key is a special case of the above.  Any key, and
its options/arguments, that is not known is ignored by the sys.  For
example, if you use the 'mac' keyword and specify the machines mac
address this key will be silently ignored.  (Having the MAC address
does not give this system any advantages.)  Options may also be
contained within double or single quotes so that an option may contain
spaces.  Also, have comments that begin with a '#' are supported.


Keys
====

    dept  <department>

Optional.  Sets the department for the machine.  Default is PAMS.

    root  <MD5 Crypt>

Optional.  Sets the root password to the password represented by the
MD5 Crypt.
        
    owner <owner>

Optional.  Take one option which should be a valid email address.  All 
of root's mail will be sent here.

    printer <printername>

Optional.  Defaults to lp.  To configure printing to a campus printer
give the name of the printer to this key as its option.

    package <packagename> 

Optional.  Defaults to "@ Realm Kit Workstation".  Use this key to
configure what packages and package groups get installed.  This key
can be used multiple times.  Specify one package or package group for
each use of the key.  (If you use this you really want to start out
with "package @ Realm Kit Workstation" and then add further packages.
Things can break hear pretty easily.)

    use <filename> 

Include another config file.  The filename must be a path to the
included file that is relative to the directory containing the Python
scripts for the system.  (Specifically, ks.py.)

    lang <default lang>

Optional.  Specify the default language.  The default is "en_US".

    langs <list of langs to install>

Optional.  Default is "en_US".  Use this key word to tell the
installer what languages to install.  You can specify multiple
languages by separating them with whitespace.

    part <partition def>

Optional.  Use this key to override the default and specify your own
partitioning scheme.  See the "part" option in the Kickstart
documentation in Red Hat's Customization guide at
http://www.redhat.com/docs to see the options this can take.

    volgroup <>
    raid <>
    logvol <>

Optional.  Only used if you specify your own partitioning scheme.  Only
implemented for version 9 kickstarts or higher.  These keywords and options
define Logical Volume Management (LVM).  These are the same keywords that
are used in a normal Red Hat kickstart and, in fact, are copied verbatim
to the resultant kickstart file.  More documentation can be found in the 
Red Hat documentation mentioned above.

    src <from/how to install>

Optional.  This key can specify how and where to install from.  There
are three options "nfs", "http", and "ftp".  The default is "http" and
will install the kit from install.linux.ncsu.edu.  The "nfs" and "ftp"
options will install using that protocol from
ftp.linux.ncsu.edu.  More options can be added in the future to
support other install methods from other mirrors.
 
    version <version string>

REQUIRED.  This key specifies what version of the Linux Realm Kit to
install.  Currently, the options are: 

    7.3
    9
    default  
    
The "default" option should install the latest stable version (9)
where the numeric option will install the Linux Realm Kit based off 
of that version of Red Hat Linux.

    grub  <MD5 Crypt>

Optional.  Use this key to specify a password from grub, the
bootloader.  You must use an MD5 Crypt here.

    mouse [options] <mouse type>

Optional.  This key will define the exact type of mouse connected to
the system.  The default value is a generic 2 button mouse with 3
button emulation.  This key behaves exactly the same way as the
'mouse' keyword in a Red Hat Kickstart.  For complete documentation of
this key please see the Kickstart Options page at the following URL. 

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.3-Manual/custom-guide/s1-kickstart2-options.html

    enable <service> [option1] [option2] [...]

Enable certain other services.  The services supported are described
below. 


Enable Style Services
=====================

    enable safepartition

Optional.  Without this option the installer will remove all existing
partitions on the system before creating new ones.  With this option
the installer will only remove Linux partitions before adding new.  
This requires pre-existing Linux partitions or unpartitioned space
on the drive.

    enable mailmasq [domain]

Optional.  Configure the domain from which email sent from this
machine should look like it is coming from.  The default is
unity.ncsu.edu.  Leave the option out to disable mail masquerading.

    enable receivemail

Optional.  Enable being able to receive email locally on this machine.

    enable consolelogin

Optional.  Enable "local" users to be able to log into the machine at
the text console.  Default only treats logins from GDM as "local."

    enable localcluster [cluster]

Optional.  Enable the use of clusters to control local logins.  The
default is to allow local users in the "ncsu" cluster to login.  (Yes,
that's everyone at NCSU.)  You can specify a cluster yourself, or
leave the cluster out to use the cluster information in hesiod.

    enable remotecluster [cluster]

Optional.  Enable the use of clusters to control remote logins.  The
default setting is to not use cluster from remote logins.  You can
specify a cluster yourself or leave blank to get cluster out of
hesiod. 

    enable norealmcron

Optional.  Disable the realmcron system.  The realmcron system updates
root and user information from AFS.  Also runs cron jobs from AFS.
This is required for support from the Realm Kit for Red Hat Linux
Developers.

   enable normalusers <user list>

Optional.  Adds given users to /etc/users.local.  Does not give the
users any administrative abilities.  Multiple user IDs can be
separated via whitespace.
 
    enable notmpclean

Optional.  Disables tmpwatch.  Not recommend.

    enable nox

Optional.  Does not configure the X server.  It will be skipped by the
installer and must be configure manually after installation.

    enable noreinstall 

Optional.  Disables the magic that lets you select Reinstall from Grub
to reinstall the machine.  The default is to set this up.  It does
require a URL of the web-kickstart server which is generated from the
Apache request object when a request to generate a Kickstart is
received.  There's a -u option to check.py to work with this as well.

    enable keepmbr

Optional.  Does not replaced the MBR with the bootloader.  Instead the
bootloader is placed in the boot partition which is normally /boot.

    enable adminusers <user list>

Optional.  Replaces the functionality of the original 'users' key in this
web-kickstart system.  This key takes a space delimited list of NCSU
user IDs and adds them to the user lists pulled from AFS that are placed
in /etc/users.local, /etc/sudoers, and /root/.klogin.
