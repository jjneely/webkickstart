* Config file format needs changing
- We don't appear to be using anthing close to what's documented
  in /afs/bp/system/config/README.example
- Geting rid of the brakets makes parsing much easer and less prone
  to breakage.  (Looks like the current stuff is real easy to break.)
- add a "use" keyword which is an include
- tokens are broken by whitespace unless in quotes
- for simplicity require that tokens may use quotes but must be
  separated by whitespace.  Otherwise the quote will be considered
  part of the token
- We need to be able to include %post snippets
- use /afs/bp/system/config/README.config as start

* use a mod_python script
- the php is a bit messy (of course, what PHP isn't...)
- things can really be done much cleaner with a python module
  and not have to rewrite code that does the same thing in a different
  lanuguage

* things we don't want to support
- upgrades  -- this is just asking for problems
- disabling user mountable media.  This doesn't work here.
- receiving email.  This is bad because we don't modify sendmail any
  more. 

* change install sources
- ftp and nfs
- then maybe ftppams/nfspams
- no coe crap
- this should be done in a more dynamic way anyway
  as in read config options out of DB

* Update the realmcron stuff to use realmconfig 

* use a dynamic way to determine what the config mean
- with a ConfigParser object ??
- pickles ??
- handle different RK versions

* use a class to define language
- can be subclassed for differences and versions

* file parsing
- use commands based on one line
- find %post section first and split out
